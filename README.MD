#Tiny Rx
Tiny Rx is/will be a very small library for creating and making use of event streams in javascript. I'm making this little library because I wanted to 1. understand what's involved in a basic implementation of an eventstream and 2. have a very tiny solution instead of using something bigger.

#Dependencies
None

##Getting Started
Since I haven't published tiny-rx on npm yet (it's still very early), just use the link to my repository
```npm install juliankrispel/tiny-rx```

Include trx in your project either via node require
```var trx = require('trx')```

or in your html file
```<script src="node_modules/tiny-rx/dist/trx.js"></script>```

create an event stream





##Credit where credit is due
Trx Inspired by [bacon.js](https://github.com/baconjs/bacon.js/tree/master) and [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS) and the amazing useful concepts these libraries make use of.
